# Jeopardy
This is my C# rendition of the Jeopardy game, Its mostly in estonian so using it might be a bit confusing 

# How to use 

When you run the exe you'll be greeted with the main menu

First button from the top lets you Load a game, but 
you first need to create a game before you can play it.

Second button takes you to the game creation screen, lets start here.

## Create a game 

On the top you'll have a text field and next to it the create button.
In jeopardy you have Topics, so this is where you can create a topic, just 
insert whatever topic you have and press on the button next to it,

You can create as many topics as your screen resolution can take,
this is upto to the users testing.

After you create a topic it will pop into the topic section as its own box, 
with one button.

Each topic would have multiple questions, so by pressing the button you can 
assign a question, which is the top most field, and add a sum, for how much 
that question is worth in the bottom field.

After you've inserted your question and sum you can press the button below the fields to 
Lock in your question.

Keep in mind, each topic should have the same amount of questions, otherwise
youll end up with a game field with some missing squares.

After youre done creating your game you can navigate to the bottom, where you see
2 buttons, left ones for going back to the menu and right one lets you save the game.

Make sure you save the file as a .ini file.

## Play a game

After you've saved your game, you can go back to the menu and press the top most button.

Here youll have two top most buttons.

Left one lets you choose a folder, so if you have many games, you can choose 
that folder and all of those files will be inserted into the list box below that button.

If you know exactly where your game is you can press on the right most button and choose your game.

Your game will be displayed in a small preview window, the UTF-8 doesnt work there for some reason, but
it works inside the game.

After you've made sure it's the right game you can just press the bottom right button.

## Gameplay

Youll be greeted with a window, which clearly has some font-sizing problems BUT
what will help is, by having the window sellected and pressing ctlr+F it will 
put the game into fullscreen, and yes, it is supposed to be slightly slow and buggy looking at first.

Overall, the game is simple, just press on one of the grids, your question will be displayed and thats it.

Enjoy!!

Notable problem, when youre playing the game and decide to close the program, youll
be greeted with 3 options from left to right:

Menu - Resume - Exit to Desktop

Resume and Exit to desktop work fine.

Going back to the menu is a big glitchy, it doesn't close the initial game, but 
it re-opens the whole exe so now you'll have 2 games open, so keep that in mind.

## Authors notes

So yes, though the product is basically playable it's very barebones and slightly buggy.

When I do get the time, I will try to re-vamp the whole program.

There are some features missing, like in the main Menu, there should be a 
How To button, which would guide you through the usage process.

Also there would be an additionally "Settings" menu, for adjusting the font size
and game resolution.
